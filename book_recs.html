        <h1>[Current] Favorite Books</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stories of Your Life & Others, Ted Chiang</strong></li>
            <p class="category"><strong>Category:</strong> Sci-Fi, Short-Story</p>
            <p class="blurb"><em>If you like black mirror or enjoy stretching your mind beyond the world we know, read this. Exhalations is the second book in this series (if one can even call it that) & it is also worth the read!</em></p>
            <li><strong>String Theory, David Foster Wallace</strong></li>
            <p class="category"><strong>Category:</strong> Non-Fiction, Short-Story</p>
            <p class="blurb"><em>This is the anthology of all DFW works about tennis.</em></p>
            <li><strong>How the Universe got it's Spots: a Diary of Finite Time in a Finite Space, Janna Levin</strong></li>
            <p class="category"><strong>Category:</strong> Non-Fiction</p>
            <p class="blurb"><em>This is the most beautifully written astrophysics book I've ever read. The weaving of her own personal journey with that of her work (researching the shape of the universe) engages the reader into becoming both intellectually & emotionally involved.</em></p>
            <li><strong>Franny & Zooey, JD Salinger</strong></li>
            <p class="category"><strong>Category:</strong> Fiction, Short-Story</p>
            <p class="blurb"><em>This is my most read book by far. Maybe I come back to it only from nostalgia at this point, but I think Salinger's genius is much better seen through the Glass family than Catcher in the Rye.</em></p>
            <li><strong>Anna Karenina</strong></li>
            <p class="category"><strong>Category:</strong> Fiction</p>
            <p class="blurb"><em>My favorite plotline in this book is that of Levin. Unfortunately, this was entirely skipped in the movie.</em></p>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><em>While these are just a few of my favorites, checkout my goodreads. Please reach out to me on tw @_grace_lily if you have any epic reads for (1) sci-fi (2) historical or (3) short story books!</em></p>
